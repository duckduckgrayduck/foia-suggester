# FOIA Request Suggester

This script is a demonstration of using the MuckRock Requests API in conjunction with LLMs. This script generates FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) or public records request language based on past successful requests from [MuckRock](https://www.muckrock.com/).  
It uses the **MuckRock Requests API** to fetch requests that were marked as complete in the past and the **Google Gemini API** to generate a suggested request draft based on this input. 
The script can also file the request directly to MuckRock once the user approves.
