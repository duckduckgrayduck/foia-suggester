# FOIA Request Suggester

This script is a demonstration of using the MuckRock Requests API in conjunction with LLMs. This script generates FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) or public records request language based on past successful requests from [MuckRock](https://www.muckrock.com/).  
It uses the **MuckRock Requests API** to fetch requests that were marked as complete in the past and allows you to pass these successful requests to Simon Willison's **llm** library to generate a suggested request draft based on this input. It allows you to select a model you'd like to run the prompt on.
The script can also file the request directly to MuckRock once the user approves.

## Install

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/duckduckgrayduck/foia-suggester.git

# or uv, which is better and faster
uv add git+https://github.com/duckduckgrayduck/foia-suggester.git
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- pip
- A MuckRock account with valid login credentials.
- Your credentials should be stored as local environment variables under MUCKROCK_USERNAME and MUCKROCK_PASSWORD for this script to work.
- [llm](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/setup.html)
- For any model that requries API calls that you select to use this tool with, you will need to [set API keys](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/setup.html#api-key-management). For more assistance with installing more models, [consult the documentation on plugins](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/index.html).
- The python-muckrock package installed in your local environment (pip install python-muckrock).
